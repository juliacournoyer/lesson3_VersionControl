            <p class="lead">
                GitHub is  a version control repository. They have the options between free and paid user accounts. The importance of GitHub being a version control repository is because as one makes edits to a code or others collaborate, the changes being made can be accounted for. If someone makes an edit that could potentially mess up the entire code, it is extremely easy for users to recover the code from before. What I think is most awesome about GitHub's features is that you can share your code online for the world to see and have someone in a totally different country use your code. What is even more awesome about that is that person in the different country can edit and enhance the code and put it on GitHub. You then have an enhanced version of your code that you might not have ever known could've existed.

                <span class="text-muted">What is version control?</span>
            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Version control is the concept of keeping multiple versions of files well organized. It constantly saves the edits of a file, keeping thr entire history of the file available. Version control is so important because it is incredibly easy to make a mistake on a file and then without proper filing of it, lose the file in its best form forever. Version control's most important job has to do with the fact that developes are collaborating all of the time. In order for people to successfully collaborate without ever having to actually meet face-to-face, developers need to be able to communicate what changes they made and why they did it. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">There are many different types of Git commands such as git init, git remote, git pull, and more. One command, git config, is used to set configuration values. The git config values that we established in this week's assignment was our name and email address. Another command, git init, creates the git directory in a new or existing project. A third command that we used for this assignment was git commit. This command creates a new commit and sets a branch to it. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">A local repository is basically where you are editing from your own computer. People can work from a local repository and not have the edits be seen immediately by others. The git command is what connects the local and remote repository so that people can then create, share, edit, and collaborate with each other. </p>

            </h2>
            <p class="lead">Remote repositories is a web service that is defined by a URL (containing http:) that is the shared version of a file. GitHub is the remote repository because people are sharing their own files onto the site to then reach anyone else on the site. This makes it easy to collaborate and also not ruin any files persmanently.</p>
